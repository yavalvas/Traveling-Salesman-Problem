# Traveling Salesman Problem
### Implementation of Random Search, Insertion and Nearest Neighbour algorithms in Python.
 
_Each algorithm calculates the total distance of the coordinates in the dataset and plots the connecting path wth NetworkX library._
 
## Project Setup
 
_To run, place all of the files in the same directory._
_wi29.tsp contains a set of 29 city coordinates. sample.tsv contains a set of 131 city coordinates._
_Output of each file will be the total distance calculated by the algorithm and the graph of path taken by the algorithm._
 
## Dependencies
 
1. NetworkX
2. Matplotlib
